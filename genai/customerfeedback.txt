The best chili crab in Singapore
Aug 2021 • NONE
No signboard is famous for its chili and white pepper crabs. Its chili crab sauce is slightly different from other places. It has a sauvory (less sweet) and more fiery feel to the sauce. I love this version of chili crab. In addition, its white pepper crab is very nice too. The white pepper sauce is not over-powering but you still get the peppery kick of it when you dig into the crab. The serving staff are very friendly and attentive which is a plus point. I will go back again whenever I have cravings for chili crabs.

Bad experience unethical pricing
Jul 2021 • NONE
Very disappointing. Questionable practices with their pricing. Ordered ONE portion of clam per their recommendation from the wait staff. It was served in 4 plates for the four guests on the table. Turns out we were charged for FOUR portion ($72). No indication from the menu nor the staff we needed to order four when we clearly was concerned we ordered too much with the other dishes. Complained to the staff with no clear retribution except for 'im sorry, not sure why'
Do NOT recommend coming here and will not be coming back here.

Standard Drop for White pepper and Chilli Crab
Apr 2021 • NONE
My family and I love their white pepper crab. It has been around 4 years since my family had it, so we decided to go indulge again. Ordered 1 white pepper crab and 1 chilli crab, the flavour unlike before. It is less fragrant and spicy now. Whole family felt very thirsty for many hours after the meal (Probably due to the addition of lots of msg to replace other ingredients).

The dim sum and service is nice and commendable though.

Expensive

The food taste only average but the bill was unexpectedly pricey. Crab costs $100 but was small and doesn’t taste that great. Chinese tea for one pax costs $8.

Best Dim Sum
Sept 2020 • NONE
We visit this restaurant whenever we crave for good dim sum. They are made to order, served steaming hot and paced so that each order are not too close; letting you enjoy your meal. And the service is top notch. The staff are friendly, polite and very prompt. We enjoyed our lunch. Thank you.

Overpriced crab
Aug 2020 • NONE
Standard of the food dropped drastically. The seafood were not fresh at all. Crab was overpriced - 1kg at $120 (23 August 2020). Visit at your own risk.

Good quality Dim Sum

The dim sums from No Signboard are probably the most underrated and delicious ones in Singapore. Look pretty too!

Had chilli crab (tasted nothing out of this world), mee goreng (more like char kway teow) and fried squids and the bill came to almost $230.00.
Jumbo seafood tastes much better and cheaper

Great Crab
May 2019 • NONE
We went there to try the world famous Singapore Chilli Crab. We got a huge Alaskan crab and decided to have half of it as Singaporean Chilli Crab and the other half Salted Egg Crab. It was incredible!! We loved every single mouthful and it got us hooked on salted egg everything!

Nice Experience, Yummy.
Jan 2020 • FAMILY
Its a wonderful experience.
The Restaurant's wall are hang with beautiful graphical seafood painting.
The waiter patiently explains the food preparation & Serve the dishes with pride.
Dishes in small serving are just nice especially the 3 crabs cook in different flavors.
